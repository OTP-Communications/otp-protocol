# otp-protocol version 0.0.1

Describe the api, format, &amp; syntax of the protocol used in our otp encrypted communications

## What this project is not
This is not a project to implement quantum proof encrypted video calls. Or quantum proof voice chat. The mvp will be sending simple plaintext messages, but we want to build upon/wrap a protocol such as [RCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_Services) or [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) 
in order to support other chat capabilities such as delivery/read status indicators. 

This project will not manage users or login information. The server only stores and retrieves the encrypted messages and their metadata, but anyone can send or retrieve them. 



## Alice and Bob

Alice can be represented and addressed by a random UUID consisting of an 8 digit long hexadecimal number. This corresponds to a 64 bit integer. Same goes for Bob. This space should be large enough to make the possibility of collisions acceptable. 


## Storing One-Time-Pads
One time pads are saved in a file with a `.otp` suffix. This should be a UTF-8 encoded file. A `.otp` file may consist of any number of lines. 
Each line is composed of has 128 characters of hexadecimal as shown below(except that the hexadecimal characters will be randomized in actual usage). Lines should be CRLF terminated. 

Any line not consisting solely of 128 hexadecimal characters will be considered metadata, and can safely be ignored in version 0.0.1. 
This is specified in hopes of making some level of backwards/forwards compatibility possible.

It is suggested that the file be named following a convention similar to `{UUID for Alice}_{UUID for Bob}.v{protocol version}.otp` though this may not prove neccessary. 

For convenience, the complementary file `{UUID for Bob}_{UUID for Alice}.v{protocol version}.otp` may be created with the lines order reversed. 

## Reuse of One-Time-Pads considered harmful
Using the same section of a otp to encrypt and send different messages is in direct violation of the assumptions that make a otp unbreakable and future safe. 
To send distinct messages encrypted using the same(or overlapping) portion of the pad is considered subversive behavior. Clients should distrust any other client that does so. 

To avoid having to coordinate between Alice and Bob, Alice will send messages encrypted from the start of the pad, and Bob will send messages encrypted from the end of the pad. They may continue sending messages until meeting in the middle. Using a duplicate file with the line order reversed for decryption may be helpful. 

## Message Format

A OTP encrypted message is a wrapper that may contain a plain text message, or may wrap a more complex type such as RCS messages, or ActivityPup messages. 

### Encrypted
Each message when encrypted will look like a long series of random hexadecimal characters. The only pattern should be that the length of these messages will be a multiple of 128. 

### Decrypted

When properly decrypted, a message will start with the characters `OTP-Communications formatted message` followed by a newline (CRLF), followed by a line specifying the version of the protocol. 

The third line will consist of metadata. Probably represented using EDN or similar. Metadata should include the length of the wrapped message, and how that wrapped message should be interpreted. Similarly to how the webs ([MIME](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types)) content type works. For the mvp we can probably use `text/plain` 

The rest of the message is the embedded data/message. This may be textual, or it may be binary data interpreted as the metadata line specifies. Most decrypted messages will have some garbage bytes at the end. (because we consume our `.otp` files one line at a time)
