# otp-protocol version 0.0.1

Describe the api, format, &amp; syntax of the protocol used in our otp encrypted communications

## What this project is NOT
This is not a project to implement quantum future proof encrypted video calls. Or quantum proof voice chat. The mvp will be sending simple plaintext messages, but we want to build upon/wrap a protocol such as [RCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_Services) or [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) 
in order to support other chat capabilities such as delivery/read status indicators. 

This project will not manage users or login information. The server only stores and retrieves the encrypted messages and their metadata, but anyone can send or retrieve them. 

This project will not neccesarily anonymize the identities of participants. That is, eavesdropping the communications over the internet may reveal who is talking to whom. This project is instead focused on encrypting the message body in a quantum future proof manner using One Time Pads. 



## Alice and Bob

Alice can be represented and addressed by a random ID consisting of an 8 digit long hexadecimal number. This corresponds to a 64 bit integer. Same goes for Bob. This space should be large enough to make the possibility of collisions acceptable. 

Alternately, we should consider using standardized [GUIDs](http://guid.one/).


## Message Format

A OTP encrypted message is a wrapper that may contain a plain text message, or may wrap a more complex type such as [RCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_Services) messages, or [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) messages. 

### Encrypted
Each message when encrypted will look like a long series of random hexadecimal characters. The only pattern should be that the length of these messages will be a multiple of 128. 

### Decrypted

When properly decrypted, a message will start with the characters `OTP-Communications formatted message` followed by a newline (CRLF), followed by a line specifying the version of the protocol. 

The third line will consist of metadata. Probably represented using EDN or similar. Metadata should include the length of the wrapped message, and how that wrapped message should be interpreted. Similarly to how the webs ([MIME](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types)) content type works. For the mvp we can probably use `text/plain` 

The rest of the message is the embedded data/message. This may be textual, or it may be binary data interpreted as the metadata line specifies. Most decrypted messages will have some garbage bytes at the end. (because we consume our `.otp` files one line at a time)



## One Time Pads


### Storing One-Time-Pads
One time pads are saved in a file with a `.otp` suffix. This should be a UTF-8 encoded file. 

The first line of the file is for metadata. The rest of the file consists of hexadecimal characters, which constitute the one-time-pad.

It is suggested that the file be named following a convention similar to `{UUID for Alice}_{UUID for Bob}.v{protocol version}.otp` though this may not prove neccessary. 

For convenience, the complementary file `{UUID for Bob}_{UUID for Alice}.v{protocol version}.otp` may be created with the pad byte order reversed. 

### Reuse of One-Time-Pads considered harmful
Using the same section of a otp to encrypt and send different messages is in direct violation of the assumptions that make a otp unbreakable and future safe. 
To send distinct messages encrypted using the same(or overlapping) portion of the pad is considered subversive behavior. Clients should distrust any other client that does so. 

To avoid having to coordinate between Alice and Bob, Alice will send messages encrypted from the start of the pad, and Bob will send messages encrypted from the end of the pad. They may continue sending messages until meeting in the middle. Using a duplicate file with the line order reversed for decryption may be helpful. 

### Generating the OTP

Suggested generation size is ~ 1 MB. I think that this is sufficient for sending many thousands of text messages without having to re-exchange pads. It is also small enough that a modern mobile device should be able to store pads for communication with scores of contacts. 

### Transferring OTPs

If Alice generates the OTP, a copy must also be given to Bob. With mobile devices this may be done using NFC or Bluetooth communication. Generating a QR code on one device, and scanning it with the other will likely not provide sufficient bandwidth. 

For the mpv, the client application should be able to manually import a `.otp` file, and save it with required metadata about the Contact and server endpoints. This file may be securely transfered between devices with something like a thumb drive and OTG adaptor. Sharing the file with bluetooth also works admirably.
